# Kaggle Competition: Flood Prediction

This repository contains the code and related files used for participating in a Kaggle competition focused on predicting flood probabilities. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and submission of predictions. The analysis is performed using both Python and R, demonstrating different approaches and methodologies in each language.

## Repository Contents

### Python Implementation

- **File:** `flood_prob_analysis_in_python.py`
- **Description:** This script contains the analysis and modeling steps for flood probability prediction using Python. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### R Implementation

- **File:** `flood_prob_analysis_in_R.R`
- **Description:** This script contains the analysis and modeling steps for flood probability prediction using R. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### Requirements

- **Python Requirements:** `python_requirements.txt`
- **R Requirements:** `R_requirements.txt`

## Getting Started

To get started with the analysis, you will need to have Python and R installed on your system. Below are the steps to set up the environment and run the scripts.

### Prerequisites

#### Python

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages listed in `python_requirements.txt`

#### R

- R version 4.x or higher
- Required R packages listed in `R_requirements.txt`

### Installation

#### Python

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arhabhasan/FloodProbabilityPrediction.git
   cd FloodProbabilityPrediction
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r python_requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python flood_prob_analysis_in_python.py
   ```

#### R

1. Open the R script `flood_prob_analysis_in_R.R` in RStudio or your preferred R environment.

2. Install required packages by running:
   ```R
   source('R_requirements.txt')
   ```

3. Run the R script:
   ```R
   source('flood_prob_analysis_in_R.R')
   ```

## Project Structure

- `flood_prob_analysis_in_python.py`: Python script for flood probability analysis.
- `flood_prob_analysis_in_R.R`: R script for flood probability analysis.
- `python_requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `R_requirements.txt`: List of required R packages.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering
- Data normalization and scaling

### Modeling

- Selection of appropriate models
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model training and validation

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using R-squared values, which measure the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

## Submissions

The predictions for the test data are saved into CSV files which can be directly uploaded to Kaggle for submission.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
